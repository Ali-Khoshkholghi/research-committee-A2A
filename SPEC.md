# Research Committee — A2A Multi-Agent Project Spec

## Goal

Build a small standalone "committee of agents" research assistant using the
**A2A (Agent2Agent) protocol** (Linux Foundation, v1.0). A human asks a
research question; a chair agent delegates to three specialist agents over
A2A, streaming progress the whole way, and returns a synthesized, checked
answer.

This is a learning project — prioritize a correct, minimal implementation of
each A2A concept over feature completeness. Build and verify one agent at a
time, in the order below. Do not skip ahead to the chair until each
downstream agent works in isolation.

## Tech choices (already decided — do not deviate)

- Language: **Python**, using the official A2A Python SDK.
- Transport: **JSON-RPC 2.0** with **SSE streaming** (`message/stream`),
  not REST or gRPC.
- Local-only for now: all agents run on `localhost` on different ports.
- No auth/security hardening needed for v1 — flag it as a TODO, don't
  implement it yet.

## Agents

| Agent | Port | Skill (Agent Card) | Streams? | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lit_search` | 9001 | `find-sources` | yes — one source at a time via `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` | list of `{title, url, snippet}` as DataParts |
| `synthesis` | 9002 | `draft-answer` | yes — text chunks via `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` with `append: true` | drafted paragraph(s), TextPart |
| `critic` | 9003 | `verify-claims` | no — single final DataPart | list of `{claim, supported: bool, note}` |
| `chair` | 9000 | `research-question` (the only skill a human calls) | yes — relays committee progress upward | final answer + critique summary |

Each agent (including `chair`) must publish a valid A2A **Agent Card** at
`/.well-known/agent-card.json` with accurate `name`, `description`, `url`,
`capabilities.streaming`, `defaultInputModes`, `defaultOutputModes`, and a
`skills` array describing exactly what it does. Treat agents as opaque to
each other — no agent should assume internal implementation details of
another; they only know each other via Agent Cards.

## Build order (do not parallelize — each step must run before the next starts)

### Step 1 — `lit_search` agent (fake data first)
Minimal A2A server. Publishes its Agent Card. Implements `message/stream`
for skill `find-sources`. For now, fake 3–5 sources with a short `sleep()`
between each, streamed as separate `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`s (DataPart per
source), ending with `lastChunk: true` and task state `completed`. No real
web search yet — the goal is to prove the A2A streaming/task/artifact
mechanics work end-to-end.

### Step 2 — raw JSON-RPC/SSE test client
A standalone script (not the chair) that calls `lit_search` directly via
`message/stream` and prints each `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` /
`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` as it arrives. This is a debugging tool to
visually confirm the stream — keep it in the repo as
`common/debug_client.py`.

### Step 3 — `synthesis` and `critic` agents
Same A2A server pattern as `lit_search`, different skills:
- `synthesis` (`draft-answer`): takes a topic + list of sources (DataParts),
  streams back a drafted answer as TextPart chunks with `append: true`,
  final chunk has `lastChunk: true`.
- `critic` (`verify-claims`): takes the drafted answer + sources, returns
  ONE final DataPart with per-claim verdicts. No streaming needed here —
  use `message/send` semantics for this one internally, but still expose
  `message/stream` on the Agent Card for consistency (can just emit a
  single event).

Each should support the `input-required` task state for at least one
realistic case (e.g. `lit_search` asks for date-range/source-count if not
specified; `synthesis` asks which sources to prioritize if `lit_search`
returned conflicting or ambiguous results). Implement this properly — it's
the part of A2A most people skip, and it's a core learning goal here.

### Step 4 — `chair` agent
On startup, fetches all three Agent Cards (`lit_search`, `synthesis`,
`critic`) to confirm they're reachable and capable before accepting any
human request. Publishes its own Agent Card with skill `research-question`.
On a human request:
1. Calls `lit_search` via `message/stream`, relays/logs its
   `TaskStatusUpdateEvent`/`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`s as they arrive.
2. Feeds the completed source list into `synthesis`, same streaming
   relay pattern.
3. Feeds the drafted answer + sources into `critic`.
4. Returns the final synthesized answer plus the critic's verdict list as
   the chair's own task artifact/result.

Correlate all sub-tasks under a shared `contextId` so the whole exchange is
traceable as one logical conversation, even though each is a separate A2A
Task.

### Step 5 — swap in real data
Only after steps 1–4 work end-to-end with fake data: replace `lit_search`'s
fake source generator with a real web search call. Everything else should
be unaffected, since the A2A contract (Agent Card + task/artifact shape)
doesn't change.

## Definition of done for each step

- Agent Card is fetchable and schema-valid.
- `message/stream` produces a correctly ordered sequence of
  `TaskStatusUpdateEvent`/`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`s ending in a terminal
  task state (`completed`, `failed`, or `canceled`).
- At least one `input-required` round-trip is implemented somewhere in the
  system (per step 3).
- `common/debug_client.py` can hit any agent independently and print a
  readable stream.

## Explicitly out of scope for v1

- Auth / Agent Card signature verification.
- Multi-tenancy.
- gRPC/REST bindings.
- Deployment beyond localhost.
- Persistent storage of tasks (in-memory is fine).
